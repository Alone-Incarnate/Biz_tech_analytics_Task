# 🧤 **Glove vs No-Glove Detection**

This project is part of a **safety compliance system** that checks whether workers are wearing gloves on factory floors.  
A fine-tuned **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** model is used to detect two classes:

1. 🧤 **glove**
2. ✋ **no_glove**

The system processes a folder of images and generates:

- 🟦 **Annotated images** with bounding boxes  
- 📝 **JSON logs** containing labels, confidence scores, and bounding box coordinates

## 📂 **Dataset**

I created a **custom dataset** by manually collecting images of hands with and without gloves.  
All images were annotated using **VoTT** in **Pascal VOC format**, then converted into **YOLO format**.

## 🔧 **Augmentation Used**

To improve model performance and robustness, the following augmentations were applied:

1. 🔄 **Flips**  
2. 🔍 **Zoom**  
3. 💡 **Brightness adjustment**  
4. ✨ **Sharpness adjustment**  
5. 🔁 **Rotation**
